String challenge
Have the function stringchallenge (str) read the str parameter being passed which will contain the written out version of the numbers 0-9 and the words "minus" or "plus" and convert the expression into an actual final number written out as well. For example: if str is "foursixminustwotwoplusonezero" then this converts to "46 - 22 + 10" which evaluates to 34  and your program should return the final string threefour. If your final answer is negative it should include the word "negative."

Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your challengeToken, and then replace every fourth character with an underscore.
Your ChallengeToken: taqgzk826
Examples
Input: "onezeropluseight"
Output: oneeight
Final Output: one_igh_taq_zk8_6
